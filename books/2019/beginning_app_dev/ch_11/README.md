# Making RESTful API Calls with HTTP

## Now we know how to create a Flutter app, use external libraries and asynchronously read and write data in JSON format. That actually puts us in a great position to go just one small step forward and exchange data with an API server, something that is absolutely essential if we are going to write real-world apps. Here’s what we need to know:

## What is an API call anyway?
## Making an HTTP GET or DELETE request.
## Making an HTTP POST, PUT, or PATCH request.
## Handling the response in the simplest way.
## Cleaner handling with FutureBuilder and StreamBuilder.
## Cleaner handling with strongly typed objects.

## That’ll be our plan for this chapter. That, and getting in some hands-on practice with a web site that allows HTTP updates. And to make sure everyone is on the same page (pun definitely intended), we should probably start with what exactly an API is. Feel free to skim it or skip altogether if you’re already familiar.
