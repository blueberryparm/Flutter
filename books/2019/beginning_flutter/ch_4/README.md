# Creating a Starter Project Template

## In this chapter, you will learn how to create a Flutter starter project and how to structure the widgets. (I'll cover widgets in depth in the next three chapters.) In future chapters, every time you start a new example, I'll refer to this chapter, which contains the steps to create a new starter project. Like when building a home, the foundation is the most critical factor, and the same is true when creating new apps.

## WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THIS CHAPTER

### How to create folders in the project, grouping them by file types
### How to separate and structure widgets into different files
