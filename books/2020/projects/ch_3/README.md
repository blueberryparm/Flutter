# Chapter 3

## My Time â€“ Listening to a Stream of Data, shows a more advanced way of dealing with state: listening to streams of data. In this project, you will create a productivity timer, with an animation based on streams. This chapter will introduce asynchronous programming in Flutter and several core concepts, such as navigation, using libraries, and storing data. 

## It will be a good exercise in learning several important Flutter features that we haven't touched on so far, such as the following:

## Building a layout leveraging an external library
## Listening to data streams and using asynchronous programming
## Navigating from one screen to another in your app
## Using shared preferences to persist data in your device
## Using a GridView and choosing the right colors for your app
