# Using Firebase with Flutter

## There are no shortage of server solutions out there like AWS from Amazon, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Alibaba Cloud, and so many others. They’re all great. We chose to focus on Firebase, not because it is head and shoulders better than the others but because

## 1. Firebase and Flutter are both Google products, so there are a few synergies.
 
## 2. Firebase is at least as good as, and in some ways better than, the other options.
 
## 3. Firebase is (fairly) easy to set up and free for low volumes – perfect for learning and testing.
 
## 4. Firebase has been getting a ton of attention in the developer community lately. It is becoming the tech that hiring managers and recruiters want to see on your resume.
 
## 5. We had to pick one, so why not Firebase?

## If we are going to implement Firebase as a server to use with Flutter, we need to make sure we understand these things:
### Firebase at a very high level
### How to set up a Firebase project
### How to make it work with our eventual iOS and Android apps
### Integrating it in our Flutter app with authorization
### Reading Firestore data into our Flutter app
### Querying data in Flutter
### Changing data in Flutter
### Deleting data in Flutter

## So that will be our game plan for this chapter. Let’s start with an intro to Firebase itself.
