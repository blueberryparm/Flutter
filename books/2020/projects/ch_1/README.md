# Chapter 1

## Hello Flutter! is an introductory chapter, where you'll build "Hello Flutter," an app that shows the presentation screen of a fictitious travel agent. The project will focus on how to create a very basic app with Dart and Flutter and give you the foundation necessary for the rest of the book.
