## An app that is going to display a ListView of ListTiles. There will be a tile for each comic and tapping on a tile should display the details of that comic.

## We’ll be using a simple HTTP API that requires no authentication: the popular comic site XKCD’s API.

## WHY XKCD?
### You are probably already familiar with the XKCD website: its comics are often shared in engineering and computer-related communities (especially software development ones), and the XKCD API is very simple to use and requires no authentication, which means you will be able to use the code examples in this chapter without having to update placeholder API keys with ones you get by signing up for the usage of the API like you would if the example was about an API that requires authentication.
