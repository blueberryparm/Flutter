# Accessing Device Features from the Flutter App

## Mobile applications do not live alone in the device and user context, and this is true for every level of applications, from simpler single-purpose applications to more complex ones. An application may need to access hardware features such as Bluetooth, the camera, import a contact to let the user interact with friends, or share content to other apps and users. So, a developer needs to make the application aware of the user and the device.

## In this chapter, you will learn how to integrate an app to the user context, such as displaying and launching a URL, managing platform permissions, launching a phone's camera, and importing a contact.

## The following topics will be covered in this chapter:

## Launching a URL from the app

## Managing app permissions

## Importing a contact from a phone
