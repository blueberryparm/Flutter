# Chapter 7

## Firing Up the App - Integrating Firebase into a Flutter App. The app we'll build in this project is an event app. Your user will be able to see the program of an event— for example, a developers' conference, a concert, or a business meeting—and, once authenticated, they will be able to select their favorite parts of the schedule. All the data will be saved remotely, in a Cloud Firestore database.

## The following topics will be covered in this chapter:

## Creating a Firebase project
## Adding Firebase and Firestore to your app
## Reading data from a Firestore database and showing it in your Flutter app
## Implementing an authentication screen and connecting it to Firebase
## Writing data to a Firestore database (create, read, update, delete (CRUD))
