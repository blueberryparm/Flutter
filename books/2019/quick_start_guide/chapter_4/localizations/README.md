# localizations

## Internationalizing Flutter

### App will be viewed by an international audience. You will have to provide locale support for the specific language of the target.

### That means you'll need to write the app in a way that your app renders the values like text and layouts depending on each language or locale that the app supports.

### Flutter has made it simple by providing support by classes and widgets.

### Flutter supports the global localization classes for about 24 languages.
