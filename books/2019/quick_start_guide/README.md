# Google Flutter Mobile Development Quick Start Guide

## Flutter is a cross-platform mobile application development framework. It uses the Dart programming language, which was created by Google, and aims to make development easier, faster, and more efficient. This book is going to be your guide, from introducing Flutter to successfully developing a cross platform application.

## In the first few chapters, we will learn what Flutter is and how to get started with it. We will also take a dive into the widgets world, explore the widget catalog, and learn how to navigate through it. In the next few chapters, we will widen our horizon by learning about networking and accessibility with Flutter. We'll learn what Silvers are and how to use them, and we'll also learn how to use constraints and animations. Before we take a look at how to deploy our applications in Flutter, we will use Firebase for cloud messaging and remote configuration.

## By the end of the book, you will have learned everything you need to know to get started with your journey of cross-platform mobile development with Flutter.
