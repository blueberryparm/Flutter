# friend_favors

## The Friend Favors app will be a small network where a friend may ask a favor of another friend, and that friend may accept or refuse to do the favor. By accepting, the favor enters in the user's favors-to-do list. It's like a to-do app where tasks to do are proposed by the user's friends and only accepted or rejected by the user.

## It will consist of two screens. The first screen will be a list of favors, and the second one will be a form for asking a favor of a friend.
