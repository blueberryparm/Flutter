# shopping

## The Shopping List app is made of two screens. The first screen, which the user will see when they open the app, shows a shopping list.

## Each item on the list has a priority, which is the number you see on the left of the preceding screenshot, a name (Bakery, Fruit, and so on), and an edit button on the right. When you swipe on any of the items in the list, the item will be deleted, and when you tap on the edit button, the app will show an edit dialog screen, allowing you to edit the Shopping List name and priority.

## When you tap on one of the shopping lists, you'll get to the second screen of the app, which shows another list: the items contained in the shopping list you selected.
