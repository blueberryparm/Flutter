## Building a REST Service
### One of the most prominent tasks for developers is to build REST services for the project that help you gather data in JSON format, which you can reflect on the front-end of the application. 

## JSON Server
### A JSON server is a simple project that stimulates REST API with CRUD operation.
### Json-server works in a JSON file, and creating a JSON file is simple.

## Building a resource file
### A resource is anything that has data associated with it. The API endpoints help you to retrieve or update the data on the server.
### we will use the resources as a JSON file. This JSON file will act as a config and database file for the mock server you set up using json-server.

### This project hardly consumes time for the setup, and you can swiftly process the data to ensure that everything works as expected. It is ideal for developers who are learning to build REST APIs to understand how the data is processed with a backend for prototyping and mocking.
### Note that this project builds a full fake REST API for demo purposes only.
