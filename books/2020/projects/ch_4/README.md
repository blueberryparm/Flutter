# Chapter 4

## Pong Game â€“ 2D Animations and Gestures, is about making a simple two-dimension animated game, where a ball will move across the screen, and the player will need to prevent the ball from "falling" out of the screen. The main topics of this chapter include using animations, detecting gestures with the Gesture Detector, and generating random numbers.

## In particular, the topics we will cover include the following:

## Using Stack and Positioned to build the user interface
## Using Animation and AnimationController to build Tween animations
## Using GestureDetector
## Using Random() from the Dart Math library
