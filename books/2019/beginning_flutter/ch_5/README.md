# Understanding the Widget Tree

## The widgettree is how you create your UI; you position widgets within each other to build simple and complex layouts. Since just about everything in the Flutter framework is a widget, and as you start nesting them, the code can become harder to follow. A good practice is to try to keep the widget tree as shallow as possible. To understand the full effects of a deep tree, you'll look at a fullwidgettree and then refactor it into a shallowwidgettree, making the code more manageable. You'll learn three ways to create a shallow widget tree by refactoring: with a constant, with a method, and with a widget class.
