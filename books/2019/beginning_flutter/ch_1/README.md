# Introducing Flutter and Getting Started

## In this chapter, you'll learn how the Flutter framework works behind the scenes. Flutter uses widgets to create the user interface (UI), and Dart is the language used to develop the applications. Once you understand how Flutter handles and implements widgets, it will help you in architecting your apps.

## You'll learn how to install the Flutter SDK on macOS, Windows, and Linux. You'll configure Android Studio to install the Flutter plugin to run, debug, and use hot reload. You'll install the Dart plugin for code analysis, code validation, and code completion.
