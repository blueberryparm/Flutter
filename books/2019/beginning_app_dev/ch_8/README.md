# Styling Your Widgets

## Styling your widgets isn’t entirely new to you. We’ve touched on some minor styling features in prior chapters, and you’ve seen styling techniques in our code samples. But this is the chapter where we’ll take a deep dive on styling. Finally! We get to make our widgets look great in addition to merely working great.

## We covered layouts in Chapter 6, “Laying Out Your Widgets,” so we know how to set the location and sizes of our widgets. That’s not styling. Styling is the other stuff that affects the appearance of widgets. Things like:


## Colors
## Text appearance (fonts, weights, underlines, etc.)
## Borders (thicknesses, patterns, corner radii)
## Background images
## Applying shapes to a Container

## We’ll discuss these along with a couple of Flutter widgets where there is considerable overlap between layout and styling: Cards and Stacks. Lastly, we’ll talk about the best practice of applying default styles en masse using Themes.

## But first a few words about the philosophy of styles in Flutter.
