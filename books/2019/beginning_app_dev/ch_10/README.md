# Your Flutter App Can Work with Files

## At this point in our journey, you’ve learned how to create a Flutter app and precisely control how it looks and lays out in any orientation and on any device. That’s pretty cool! You know how to have it maintain data with Form fields. But how do we get it to save that data? How do we get it to read that data in the first place?

## Your app’s data can only come from two places: from within the device itself or by exchanging data with an external server. We’ll deal with external servers in the next chapter. In this chapter, let’s learn to read and write data from on-device storage options. But in order to get there by the end of the chapter, we have to master certain prerequisite knowledge like working with JSON and handling asynchronous activities. So here will be our plan for the chapter:

## Including libraries in your Flutter app
## Bundling files in your app
## Futures, async, and await
## Reading/writing a local file
## Converting JSON
## Saving user preferences
