# Flutter Projects

## Flutter is a modern reactive mobile framework that removes a lot of the complexity found in building native mobile apps for iOS and Android. With Flutter, developers can now build fast and native mobile apps from a single codebase.

## This book is packed with 11 projects that will help you build your own mobile applications using Flutter. It begins with an introduction to Dart programming and explains how it can be used with the Flutter SDK to customize mobile apps. Each chapter contains instructions on how to build an independent app from scratch, and each project focuses on important Flutter features.From building Flutter Widgets and applying animations to using databases (SQLite and sembast) and Firebase, you'll build on your knowledge through the chapters. As you progress, you'll learn how to connect to remote services, integrate maps, and even use Flare to create apps and games in Flutter. Gradually, you'll be able to create apps and games that are ready to be published on the Google Play Store and the App Store. In the concluding chapters, you'll learn how to use the BLoC pattern and various best practices related to creating enterprise apps with Flutter.
