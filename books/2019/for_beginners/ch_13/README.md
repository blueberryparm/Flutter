# Improving User Experience

## If you want your application to reach a high level, you need to keep it open to continuous interaction with user context, even though it is not currently running. In addition, developing an internationalized and fully accessible app allows it to grow progressively. In this chapter, you'll learn how to create processes executed in the background, translate your app into the target language, and add accessibility features that improve the usability of the app.

## The following topics will be covered in this chapter:

## Accessibility in Flutter

## Adding translations to apps

## Communication between native and Flutter with platform channels

## Creating background processes

## Adding Android-specific code to run Dart code in the background

## Adding iOS-specific code to run Dart code in the background
