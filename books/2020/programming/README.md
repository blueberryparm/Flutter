# Programming Flutter

## Flutter’s entry into the mobile app development framework space is recent and, because of that, Flutter needs to carry significant improvements over existing frameworks and SDKs to actually be useful—and it does.

## For one thing, with Flutter you’ll be able to develop apps that work with Android, iOS, and Google Fuchsia. Flutter is developed by Google, but it fully supports iOS, and this means you can now also run an iOS emulator and build for iOS in Android Studio. However, you won’t be able to build iOS apps on Linux or Windows because iOS emulation and compilation is still done through Xcode.

## Flutter makes developing apps incredibly easy by allowing you to define the app’s UI declaratively but in the same place and language you define the app logic (no XML UI files required). You can instanly preview the changes you make to your app using stateful hot reload.

## Additionally, its cross-platform nature doesn’t skimp on having a native look and feel, as the framework supports all of the typical native features of each of the operating systems (different app bar, different list drag to update, Material Design and Apple icons, etc.). The advantages compared to other cross-platform frameworks don’t end there: you’ll be able to run any native Kotlin/Java and Swift/Objective-C method using platform channels, as we’ll see in ​Integrating Native Code: Making Plugin Packages​.

## Even though it’s really new, Flutter is already used by some big and established companies (as well as many smaller ones) to build cross-platform mobile apps, as you can see in Google’s Flutter Showcase Page.

## We’ll be using Flutter packages and plugins (many of them developed by Google) to build ever more useful apps, also introducing more advanced standard Flutter features such as navigation and animations.
