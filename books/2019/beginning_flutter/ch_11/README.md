# Applying Interactivity

## In this chapter, you'll learn how to add interactivity to an app by using gestures. In a mobile application, gestures are the heart of listening to user interaction. Making use of gestures can define an app with a great UX. Overusing gestures when they don't add value or convey an action creates a poor UX. You'll take a closer look at how to find a balance by using the correct gesture for the task at hand.
