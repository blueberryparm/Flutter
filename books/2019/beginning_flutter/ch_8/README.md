# Creating an App's Navigation

## In this chapter, you'll learn that navigation is a major component in a mobile application. Good navigation creates a great user experience (UX) by making it easy to access information. For example, imagine making a journal entry, and when trying to select a tag, it's not available, so you need to create a new one. Do you close the entry and go to Settings âžª Tags to add a new one? That would be clunky. Instead, the user needs the ability to add a new tag on the fly and appropriately navigate to select or add a tag from their current position. When designing an app, always keep in mind how the user would navigate to different parts of the app with the least number of taps.

## Animation while navigating to different pages is also important if it helps to convey an action, rather than simply being a distraction. What does this mean? Just because you can show fancy animations does not mean you should. Use animations to enhance the UX, not frustrate the user.
